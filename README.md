# Exploring the Prevalence of Eating Disorders Among Varying Generations and Ethnicities of Asian Americans: A Bayesian Approach

## by Emma Chi
Two phenomena that have recently been rapidly growing in magnitude and prevalence in the United States are the development of eating disorders and the growth of the Asian American population. In this project, I explored the intersection of these two, studying the prevalence of eating disorders among first and second generation Asian Americans using Bayesian principles to determine whether generation or ethnicity, if either, had a stronger effect on eating disorder prevalence. After conducting exploratory analysis and creating corresponding visualizations, I examined the horseshoe priors on the regression parameters then proceeded to fit my model using linear mixed effects regression. Finally, I evaluated my models using the posterior predictives, traceplots, and expected log pointwise predictions. Through this modeling and evaluation, I found that both groups had equal strength in modeling eating disorder prevalence and getting close to the data.
